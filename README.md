# Pentest Checklist
My Personal Common WASA Attack Type Checklist

## Common WASA Attack Type

#### Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
In an SSRF attack, the attacker can deceive the server into accessing internal services (e.g. 127.0.0.1, localhost, ) that should be restricted within the organization. [Notes](https://xmind.works/qpyTPkxH) | [PAT](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/CSRF%20Injection)

Chainable vulnerability / Requirement:
- Open Redirect
- LFI/RFI

#### CORS Misconfiguration
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Injection is a security issue that happens when a web application wrongly sets its CORS rules, allowing attackers to misuse it. [Notes](https://xmind.works/6DIPUxIm) | [PAT](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/CORS%20Misconfiguration/README.md)

Requirement:
- Request > Origin: https://evil.com
- Response > Access-Control-Allow-Credential: true
- Response > Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com OR Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null

#### API Key Abuse
APIs are the keys to an organization’s databases, so it’s essential to control who has access to them. Finding Hidden API Keys & How to Use Them. [PAT](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/API%20Key%20Leaks)
