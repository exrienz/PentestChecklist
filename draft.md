### 5. Generic Injection Based Attack
- [SQLI](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20Injection)
	- > A SQL injection attack involves inserting malicious SQL queries through client input to achieve goals such as information leakage, data disclosure/manipulation, and bypassing authorization controls.
- [SSI](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Include%20Injection)
 	- > Server Side Includes (SSI) are special instructions placed in HTML pages, which the server processes while delivering the pages, allowing you to add dynamic content to a page without using complex methods like CGI programs or other dynamic technologies.
- [Command Injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Command%20Injection)
	- > Command injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands inside a vulnerable application.
- [Directory Traversal](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Directory%20Traversal)
- [File Inclusion](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/File%20Inclusion)
- [Insecure File Upload](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files)
- [SSRF](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery)
	- > Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a server into making requests to other resources (normally internal) on the internet, effectively using the server as a proxy, often leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
- [SSTI](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection)
	- > Template injection allows an attacker to include template code into an existing (or not) template. A template engine makes designing HTML pages easier by using static template files which at runtime replace variables/placeholders with actual values in the HTML pages
- HTML Injection
	- [XSS](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection) 
	- [DOM Cloberring](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Dom%20Clobbering)
